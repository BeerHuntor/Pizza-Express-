Pizza Express! 

A game developed in unity.  This is the first game of I hope many that I am developing in the Unity Game Engine with C#. 

You play as a pizza shop worker, who has to feed the hungry horde before they get to the counter and break it down - 
still in early development, but planned features include: 

* Full Shop Upgrade System
* Quirky boost system. 
* Highscores

Play a very early version at: V0.2 https://connect.unity.com/p/pizza-express-1


Changelog:
v0.3 - NOT YET RELEASED!
 * Added a pause feature where the game stops when you press the ESC or P keys.
 * Added a delivery system into the game, where you collect the deliveries and they can boost you or give you a negative effect. 
 * Implemented a money system - Pizzas when cooked cost money, earn money from feeding the customers.  New delivery system complements this feature.
 * Designed And Added new UI icons to represent the counter health, and the customers remaining and money earned.
 * Pizza slices now despawn after going out of the game view.  And also when they hit the ground. 
 * Reworked main menu and game over screens -- Added Day Count as game over stat. 
 * Added a tutorial 'how to play screen' 
 * Added particle system to show when you have fed a customer. 
 * Retextured the pizza models to give them a more uniform look. 

 ---BUG FIXES---
 * Fixed a bug where the counter health was not calculating correctly causing the game to end prematurely. 
 * Fixed a bug that allowed the player to despawn the pizza they were holding, and have infinate pizza slices
 * Fixed a bug that when happy customers spawn they collide with the hungry customers and bad things happen -- Not 100% Fixed - Can sometimes still happen.
 

 

v0.2 -
 * Added pizza slice equivelant models and made them spawn whenever you fire. 
 * Fixed the bug where the hungrycustomers jump over one another when they collide. 
 * Removed old primitive models that were used to prototype. 

KNOWN ISSUES:  
~~Counter health sometimes gets multiple collisions from one customer causing the counter to lose health rapidly and the game to end -- Ends game on 2 lives~~ - FIXED V0.3
